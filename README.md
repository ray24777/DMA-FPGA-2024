# Innovations
- **Optimization of Neural Network Accelerator**:  
   The neural network accelerator is specially optimized for license plate recognition tasks, employing a two-stage pipelining approach in the convolutional kernels to increase recognition speed and accuracy.

- **Hardware Resource Reuse**:  
   Through the reuse of convolutional layer designs, FPGA hardware resources are effectively conserved. Given that two convolutional layers in the neural network are of similar size, hardware design allows for maximum reuse, saving hardware resources. Finally, 8-bit dynamic fixed-point quantization is applied to network parameters and intermediate calculations, addressing limitations of FPGA resources and slow floating-point computation speed while ensuring computational precision.

- **Dynamic Fixed-Point Quantization**:  
   This design employs 8-bit dynamic fixed-point quantization for network parameters and intermediate calculation results, solving issues with limited FPGA resources and slow floating-point calculations. In this implementation, 8-bit signed fixed-point numbers are used to quantify data. Since the dynamic range of fixed-point numbers is small and neural networks involve many multiply-accumulate operations, there is a risk of the accelerator's results exceeding the representation range of these fixed-point numbers, which could significantly affect the accuracy of the neural network model. To address this, a dynamic mechanism is introduced. When computing between two vectors, the decimal point position for each element in a vector is consistent, but the decimal positions of the two vectors can differ. After computation, the result is trimmed to 8 bits, and this trimming process is also dynamically configurable, allowing the decimal point position of the result to be set dynamically.

- **Data Alignment in Computation Units**:  
   Since 8-bit dynamic fixed-point numbers are used in this neural network computation, decimal positions may shift after multiplication and addition. In the computation of the next network layer, differences in decimal places between two fixed-point numbers can result in errors when values are summed. Thus, after completing calculations for one layer, the results need to be adjusted to align with the format of the fixed-point numbers used in the next layerâ€™s weight data.
